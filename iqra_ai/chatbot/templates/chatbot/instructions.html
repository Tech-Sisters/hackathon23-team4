        <h4> Here is how IQRA.ai works!</h4>
        <p>You will have 4 lessons in this level, each lesson consists of 5 words. Familiarize yourself with these words in your practice sessions.</p>
        <p>After your practice sessions, for all 5 words, proceed to the test section. You will be given 5 sentences to translate, each including the word you are learning.</p>
        <p>This process will be repeated for each of the 4 lessons, so at the end of the lessons, you will be familiar with 20 words in total.</p>
        <p>You can go back and review the words in the practice sessions as many times as you like!</p>
        <p>Then, move on to the next test, where you will translate a verse that includes all the words you have learned. Once you have translated this correctly, congratulations! You can unlock the tafseer and move on to Level B, Lesson 1!</p>
